# Advanced-Database-Programming
Final semester project that uses python to execute advanced queries and update tables in mySQL, and to use data from a MongoDB client 

Database for this project comes from https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/

There is NO task1.py because task1 is just downloading the employees database into a local mySQL instance and validating it.
